# Hotel Data Dashboard

## üìä What This Project Is About

This is a Power BI dashboard that shows important information about a hotel business. The main goal is to help managers see how the business is doing.

This dashboard makes it easy to understand data about:
* Money (Revenue)
* How many rooms are filled (Occupancy)
* What guests think (Ratings)

The dashboard has three main pages:
1.  **Main Page:** A quick look at the most important numbers.
2.  **Details Page:** Shows how things change from week to week and where bookings come from.
3.  **Property Page:** Looks at each hotel and room type one by one.

## ‚ú® What the Dashboard Shows

This dashboard tracks important numbers (called KPIs) for the hotel business:

* **Total Revenue:** All the money made from bookings.
* **Occupancy %:** The percentage of hotel rooms that were full.
* **Average Rating:** The average score guests gave (from 1 to 5).
* **ADR (Average Daily Rate):** The average price a room was sold for on any given day.
* **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room):** A key number that mixes room price and how full the hotel is.

You can also **filter** the data. This means you can click buttons to see numbers for just one **City**, **Hotel**, or **Room Type**.

## üìà What We Learned from the Data

By looking at the charts, we found some useful things:

* **Best City:** **Mumbai** made the most money (**$660.9M**). But, **Delhi** had fuller hotels (**60.4%**) and the happiest guests (a **3.8** rating).

* **Best Hotels:** **Atliq Exotica** and **Atliq Palace** are the two hotels that make the most money.

* **Popular Rooms:** **Elite** rooms are the most popular (37% of bookings). **Standard** rooms are second (29%).

* **Where Bookings Come From:** "makemytrip" is a very popular website for bookings. Many people also book directly with the hotel.

* **Weekdays vs. Weekends:** The hotels make more money on **weekends ($2bn)** than on **weekdays ($1.69bn)**. This means we could offer special deals to get more people to stay during the week.
